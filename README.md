# odin-recipes

This project is part of my learning journey as I explore HTML.  
After covering the basics like elements, tags, attributes, lists and links, I'm now building a simple project to test and apply my skills, where the website is about recipes.

## 💡 What this project demonstrates:
- Structuring a web page with HTML
- Creating links, and lists
- Embedding images

## 🎯 Goals:
By completing this project, I aim to:
- Reinforce what I’ve learned in HTML foundations
- Build confidence in writing clean and meaningful HTML code
- Prepare myself for learning CSS next

## 📁 Project Status:
🚧 In Progress  
I'll update this README once the project is complete with screenshots and reflections.
